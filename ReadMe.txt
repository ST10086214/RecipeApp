2.a)
In Part 2 of the project, significant enhancements were made to the original code from Part 1. 
The most notable changes include the introduction of separate classes for `Ingredient`, 
`Recipe`, `InputHandler`, and `RecipeManager`. This restructuring allowed for a 
more organized and modular approach to the application, enhancing readability and 
maintainability. Additionally, methods were added to these classes to encapsulate 
specific functionalities, such as creating recipes, managing ingredients, and displaying recipe details. 
Despite attempts to organize the code into separate files for each class, challenges were 
encountered, possibly due to limitations within Visual Studio or procedural errors. 
Nonetheless, the resulting code adheres to international coding standards, 
incorporates comprehensive comments, and fulfills the specified requirements, 
including the use of generic collections and delegates. So overall i opted to recreate
the project from scratch given it's cluttered organization to me.

2.b)
To compile and run the software:

1. **Download the Source Code**: Download the source code files from your GitHub repository or from wherever they are stored.

2. **Open Visual Studio**: Launch Microsoft Visual Studio.

3. **Open the Solution**: Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code and open the solution file (.sln) by double-clicking on it. This will open the solution in Visual Studio.

4. **Build the Solution**: Once the solution is loaded, click on the "Build" menu at the top of the Visual Studio window and select "Build Solution". This will compile the code and resolve any dependencies.

5. **Set Startup Project**: Right-click on the project that contains the `Program` class (usually named after your project) in the Solution Explorer, and select "Set as Startup Project".

6. **Run the Application**: Press the "Start" button (usually a green arrow) in the toolbar, or press F5 on your keyboard to run the application. This will launch the console application.

7. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: Once the application is running, follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program. You can add recipes, view recipes, and exit the application based on the available options.

8. **Interact with the Application**: Use the keyboard to input your choices as prompted by the application. You can add recipes with ingredients, view the list of available recipes, and select a recipe to view its details.

9. **Exit the Application**: To exit the application, choose the appropriate option when prompted or simply close the console window.
